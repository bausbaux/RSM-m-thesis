Working as an assistant manager at almost any other store would pay so much better.\\r\\n-Either not enough hours or way too many. Sometimes you can go weeks with 20 hours, others you're forced to work 45+ because you have to cover shifts\\r\\n-Small staff and high turnover. If someone quits or gets sick, so long to your days off\\r\\n-Working off the clock is a regular thing\\r\\n-They expect you to do WAY too much. Like flipping the whole store around in one night.\\r\\n-Upper management doesn't seem to communicate at all, no one knows what's going on half the time. Most of the time one person is giving you directives that conflict directly with the directives you got from someone else.\\r\\n-RM is rude and likes to promise raises/promotions then not give them, presumably to keep you working there for as long as possible\\r\\n-Ear piercing at Claire's should be a crime. Not sterile, not safe. I've had SO many people come in about their kid's ears getting infected. Not to mention the fact that they allow us to pierce babies as young as six weeks. Imagine having a 16 year old girl pierce a child that literally came out of you six weeks ago. Absurd. And on top of all that they have this \"rapid care\" solution that we're forced to sell now. Because it's totally possible for a hole in your ear to heal in three weeks. They just want more money and don't care about actual people.\\r\\n-Ridiculous sales goals.

If someone quits or gets sick, so long to your days off\\r\\n-Working off the clock is a regular thing\\r\\n-They expect you to do WAY too much. Like flipping the whole store around in one night.\\r\\n-Upper management doesn't seem to communicate at all, no one knows what's going on half the time. Most of the time one person is giving you directives that conflict directly with the directives you got from someone else.\\r\\n-RM is rude and likes to promise raises/promotions then not give them, presumably to keep you working there for as long as possible\\r\\n-Ear piercing at Claire's should be a crime. Not sterile, not safe. I've had SO many people come in about their kid's ears getting infected. Not to mention the fact that they allow us to pierce babies as young as six weeks. Imagine having a 16 year old girl pierce a child that literally came out of you six weeks ago. Absurd. And on top of all that they have this \"rapid care\" solution that we're forced to sell now. Because it's totally possible for a hole in your ear to heal in three weeks. They just want more money and don't care about actual people.\\r\\n-Ridiculous sales goals. The only way to bonus is to exceed these goals, which never happens because we're planned us up a ludicrous amount.   \n",

       "      <td>TEK's training is the best in the industry.  They take their time and walk you through each step of the recruiting cycle.  You get to meet everyone in the office one-on-one to build internal relationships and have access to the best database of candidates in the industry.  If you have just graduated college, this is a great environment because your lack of other commitments in your life, like children or a spouse, will allow you to put the time in to become successful. People who make it past the 2.5-3 year mark are usually compensated very well for their efforts.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Do not be mis-informed: This job is the service industry.  The same way that a bartender makes more money if they take more shifts and work holidays, a recruiter will make more money the more hours they work.  In the same likeness, just because you work long hours, that doesn't mean you will get compensated well because there are so many variables to your compensation structure when it comes to commission.  You can only control so much of the process and there are a lot of things that you don't have control over that affect your income. Also, they hate the word \"micromanagement\" but I'm not sure what else to call it when someone tells you what to say, when to say it, and how to say it.  Then, they have meetings twice a day to go over how you did just that.  You'll feel like you have autonomy at first but you will realize that management has no interest in hearing new or creative ways to engage with your consultants.  Lunch is paid for but its because you work through lunch with consultants and charge those meals on your own credit card, which for most millennials comes with a high interest rate.  Having credit card debt actually works in TEKs favor because it gives you something to work for! (Getting out of debt!) \\r\\nFinally, if you are thinking about taking a job here, do NOT sign the non-compete without really looking over it.  You are essentially agreeing that if you leave, you will not recruit anywhere for the next 18 months, even if it is in a different industry.  What other job would you take where you can't work in your skill set for a year and a half after you leave?</td>\n",

       "9432008  Do not be mis-informed: This job is the service industry.  The same way that a bartender makes more money if they take more shifts and work holidays, a recruiter will make more money the more hours they work.  In the same likeness, just because you work long hours, that doesn't mean you will get compensated well because there are so many variables to your compensation structure when it comes to commission.  You can only control so much of the process and there are a lot of things that you don't have control over that affect your income. Also, they hate the word \"micromanagement\" but I'm not sure what else to call it when someone tells you what to say, when to say it, and how to say it.  Then, they have meetings twice a day to go over how you did just that.  You'll feel like you have autonomy at first but you will realize that management has no interest in hearing new or creative ways to engage with your consultants.  Lunch is paid for but its because you work through lunch with consultants and charge those meals on your own credit card, which for most millennials comes with a high interest rate.  Having credit card debt actually works in TEKs favor because it gives you something to work for! (Getting out of debt!) \\r\\nFinally, if you are thinking about taking a job here, do NOT sign the non-compete without really looking over it.  You are essentially agreeing that if you leave, you will not recruit anywhere for the next 18 months, even if it is in a different industry.  What other job would you take where you can't work in your skill set for a year and a half after you leave?   \n",

They employ people as IT Technicians, but make them work in labour jobs doing picking/packing, stock take. Then you have to lift heavy printers, UPS etc all by yourself because Fujitsu doesn't want to spend money and is all the time looking for cost cutting opportunities. Some of the senior staff are very rude and misbehave and have made it quite difficult working in an already degraded atmosphere. It is like a prison environment, people playing politics and some employees roaming around doing nothing, they don't care much about the work.  Experis will put you into this hell of an environment and keep getting promotions after promotions. They don't listen and don't care about anybody. In the end you will be the one who would be suffering because you have a family and mouths to feed. 2-3 years down the line your joints will develop cramps and your body will find it impossible to adjust.

       "6945616  Don't ever work with these guys. The pay is very low. If you are working at NIC-Fujitsu in Lidcombe for Experis, the work environment there is very bad, lots of politics. They employ people as IT Technicians, but make them work in labour jobs doing picking/packing, stock take. Then you have to lift heavy printers, UPS etc all by yourself because Fujitsu doesn't want to spend money and is all the time looking for cost cutting opportunities. Some of the senior staff are very rude and misbehave and have made it quite difficult working in an already degraded atmosphere. It is like a prison environment, people playing politics and some employees roaming around doing nothing, they don't care much about the work.  Experis will put you into this hell of an environment and keep getting promotions after promotions. They don't listen and don't care about anybody. In the end you will be the one who would be suffering because you have a family and mouths to feed. 2-3 years down the line your joints will develop cramps and your body will find it impossible to adjust. That's the story of most of the Experis employees at NIC-Fujitsu.   \n",
